Frontier Colony - Manual Test Checklist (Prototype)

1. Launch the project via Godot 4.x (e.g., `Godot_v4.5-stable_win64.exe --path . --editor`) and run the main scene.
2. Confirm the HUD shows all starting resources, colonists, and morale status.
3. Let the simulation run for at least 30 seconds:
   - Verify energy, water, and food trend upward.
   - Ensure morale nudges upward when needs are met.
4. Press `B` to open the build menu, click the Solar Panel button, and confirm the “Structures” list adds the new entry alongside a success status message.
5. Still in the menu, attempt to construct a Water Extractor twice: the first succeeds, the second should warn about insufficient resources while leaving totals and structure counts unchanged.
6. Toggle pause with `P`, then adjust tick speed with `[` and `]` to ensure the simulation speed responds correctly.
7. After stockpiling water, place several Hydroponics Bays to overconsume water and observe morale falling plus slower production while shortages persist.
