Frontier Colony - Manual Test Checklist (Prototype)

1. Launch the project via Godot 4.x (e.g., `Godot_v4.5-stable_win64.exe --path . --editor`) and run the main scene.
2. Confirm the HUD shows all starting resources, colonists, and morale status.
3. Let the simulation run for at least 30 seconds:
   - Verify energy, water, and food trend upward.
   - Ensure morale nudges upward when needs are met.
4. Press `B` to focus the construction panel, build a Solar Panel, and confirm the button updates with the new count and the log records the success.
5. Build one Water Extractor, then attempt to build a second immediately to verify the insufficient resources warning while totals stay unchanged.
6. Build a Metal Mine and watch the metal resource increase after a few ticks; verify the resource line shows a positive delta.
7. Construct a Foundry to begin producing components, then add a Research Lab to generate data; confirm their deltas turn positive once powered.
8. Build a Battery Storage unit once resources allow and confirm the Power section reports the new battery capacity and charge.
9. Toggle pause with `P`, then adjust tick speed with `[` and `]` to ensure the simulation speed responds correctly.
10. After stockpiling water, place several Hydroponics Bays to overconsume water and observe morale falling plus slower production while shortages persist.
